- 👋 Hello, I am @Chris-Rextus. I ain't nobody too special and I'm not into pretending the opposite. Instead, I'm just saying I'm a Computer Science student that, once entered this area not too much time ago and
don't know much about anything, am desperate for learning the fastest I can. Creating this GitHub account is part of the process.

- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much everything. From Phylosophy to Math, and from Neurology to AI.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at Federal University of São Carlos, in São Paulo, Brazil.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can make me grow. Please, give me something to work with if your reading this.
  
- 📫 You can reach me in my personal cellphone number (+55 17 99626-6380), in my personal e-mail (pedroaugustofaria1@outlook.com), or in my institutional e-mail (pedroaugustofaria@estudante.ufscar.br).
